  title: "RESTful OTP Service API"
  description: |
    An API for user authentication using phone numbers and one-time passwords (OTP).
    
    **Authentication Flow:**
    1.  A user initiates sign-in/sign-up by providing their phone number to the `/auth/initiate` endpoint.
    2.  The service sends a 6-digit OTP to that number (simulated in logs).
    3.  The user submits the phone number and the received OTP to the `/auth/verify` endpoint.
    4.  Upon successful verification, the user receives a JWT for authenticating future requests.
    
    **Security Features:**
    - Rate limiting on OTP requests to prevent abuse.
    - A limit on failed verification attempts to prevent online brute-force attacks.

        Initiates the authentication process for a given phone number.
        This endpoint is rate-limited. If called too frequently for the same number, it will return a 429 error.
        On success, the service generates an OTP and sends it to the provided phone number (simulated via server logs).
